**An IMPOSSIBLE List is not a bucket list. A bucket list is static - you make it once and likely forget about it.**

An IMPOSSIBLE List grows with you over time. It's designed to help you push our limits and do something IMPOSSIBLE every day. As you get stronger and better, you'll see your impossible list expands along with your goals and your life.
