Hi, I'm Shan Eapen Koshy ðŸ‘‹! I'm a **Software Engineer** with over four years of experience building scalable and impactful solutions. My expertise lies in backend development, cloud architecture, and crafting Chrome extensions that solve real-world problems.

## My Journey

I discovered my passion for technology during college, solving coding challenges and experimenting with new ideas. Over the years, I've worked on exciting projects, including integrating generative AI into business solutions and designing efficient AWS architectures. More recently, I've explored entrepreneurship, selling Chrome extensions and creating innovative tools.

## What I Do

- **Software Development**: Crafting robust, efficient, and scalable solutions.
- **Cloud Architecture**: Designing and optimizing applications on AWS.
- **Entrepreneurship**: Building and selling tools like Chrome extensions that make a difference.
- **Content Creation**: Sharing my experiences on my tech blog, [Codegena](https://codegena.com).

## Tech I Use

Here are some tools and technologies I work with regularly:

- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript, Python
- **Frameworks**: React, Node.js, Django, FastApi
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (S3, Lambda, SQS, etc.)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, MongoDB
- **Other Tools**: Docker, Git, Postman, Visual Studio Code

## My Car ðŸš—

I drive a **Volkswagen Taigun**, and itâ€™s been a fantastic companion for my road trips and daily commutes. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve driven around 20,000 kilometers, and itâ€™s been worth every penny for the joy of driving.

## Outside Work

When I'm not coding, you might find me:

- Planning my next adventure
- Writing blogs about tech and life.
