# It was magical!

Myself, Vignesh Hari and Sharad Joe decided to go for the Coldplay concert. We bought reseller tickets through Viagogo for 3x the normal price without even knowing for sure it's legit. I got my ticket a week later through Fedex shipping with a simple white paper note and ID copy of the original ticket owner. Few days before the event as soon as Sharad was trying to collect his ticket from a local store as mentioned he came to know that it was no longer available. He got the refund thankfully! I met Vivek there who I met during my Goa trip with Sharad in 2022. Vivek runs a successful textile printing company.
