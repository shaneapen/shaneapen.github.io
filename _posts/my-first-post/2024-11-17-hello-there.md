Welcome to my corner of the internet!

Iâ€™m Shan, a software engineer, tinkerer, and occasional explorer of the entrepreneurial side of tech. My journey in the world of software started with college coding challenges and has since evolved into building impactful solutions, from Chrome extensions to AWS-powered generative AI projects.

In this blog, I plan to share thoughts, ideas, and experiencesâ€”whether it's about my favorite coding hacks, the lessons Iâ€™ve learned while pricing and pitching projects, or even the story of how I accidentally made my first internet dollar (yes, that actually happened!).

When Iâ€™m not knee-deep in code, you might find me driving my Volkswagen Taigun, contemplating the best chicken shawarma, or musing about how standing desks and 3D printers might fit into my life.

This space is where Iâ€™ll share not just my work but also the things that inspire meâ€”be it technology, travel, or the occasional motivational nudge we all need. I hope to make this a place where we can learn and grow together.

Thanks for stopping by, and Iâ€™m excited to have you here as I build this little universe of thoughts!
